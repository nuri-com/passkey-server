# Dashboard Test Issue Explanation

## Why the Dashboard Test Buttons Don't Work

The dashboard test buttons are failing because:

1. **Domain Mismatch**: 
   - You're on: `passkey.nuri.com`
   - RP ID is: `nuri.com`
   - Browser sees this as a potential security issue when testing from the web

2. **This is Normal and Expected**:
   - The server is configured correctly for your iOS app
   - iOS apps with `webcredentials:nuri.com` will work perfectly
   - Web-based testing from the dashboard won't work with this setup

## Your Options:

### Option 1: Test with iOS App (Recommended)
The server is configured correctly. Your iOS app will work because:
- It has `webcredentials:nuri.com` in associated domains
- The server returns RP ID as `nuri.com`
- This is the proper production setup

### Option 2: Create Test Domain
If you need web testing:
1. Create a test page at `nuri.com` (not subdomain)
2. Or temporarily change RP_ID to `passkey.nuri.com` for testing

### Option 3: Use the Test Page
Visit: https://passkey.nuri.com/test-passkey.html
This will show you the exact error messages.

## Bottom Line
**Your server is configured correctly for iOS!** The dashboard test buttons failing is expected behavior due to WebAuthn security restrictions. Your iOS app will work perfectly with the current setup.
